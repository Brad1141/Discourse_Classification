Questions
- what is the prediction string? 
    - the numbers in the prediction string represent the words in the sequence
    - only apply to the corresponding document
    - rely on prediction string as the target column, not discourse start & end

- why is the test only 5 txt files?
    - probably tested on a private list as well

Possible approaches
- ner token classification
- word2vec (idk)

To Do
- align labels with tokens v/
- change the ner_tags from an array of strings to an array of integers v/
- why do some of the inputs give errors? v/
    - because ner_tags are less than the tokens (caused by '.' and ',' being added to tokens)

Stats
- about 3 hours to run 10,000 text files

Result Analysis (wait until kaggle to do Analysis - focus on school reseach)
